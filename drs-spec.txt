Age of Empires DRS archive specification 1.01

Files in a DRS archive do not have "names" in the typical sense.
They have an ID and an extension.

DRS Format

== Header ==
The DRS header contains a copyright string, a version string,
an archive type string, the number of embedded files,
and the offset of the first embedded file from the start of the DRS archive.

Length      C# Type     Description
40 bytes    string      Copyright Info
4 bytes     string      Archive Version
12 bytes    string      Archive Type
4 bytes     int         Table Count
4 bytes     int         1st File Offset

== Table Headers ==
Files are sorted by their file extension into 'tables'.
This makes extracting specific file types easier since each table only contains a single file type.

Table headers are laid out like so:
Length      C# Type     Description
1 byte      string      Related to file type
3 bytes     string      Extension (reversed)
4 bytes     int         Table Offset
4 bytes     int         File Count

Table headers are sequential.
They are not like so: [header][data][header][data]
Instead they are:     [header][header][data][data]
So read all of the header info before diving into data.

== Tables ==
At the start of each table is n groups of data related to the files in this table (where n is File Count).

Length      C# Type     Description
4 bytes     int         File ID
4 bytes     int         File Offset
4 bytes     int         Table Size

You can generate a psuedo-name for each file in the table you are currently iterating by doing:
FileID + "." + currentTable.Extension

Be sure to reverse currentTable.Extension either when parsing it or when creating the psuedo-name.
