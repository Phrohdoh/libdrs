Age of Empires DRS Archives

Files in a DRS archive do not have "names" in the typical sense.

They have an ID and an extension.
DRS Format
Header

The DRS header contains a copyright string, a version string,
an archive type string, the number of embedded files,
and the offset of the first embedded file from the start of the DRS archive.

Note that after the tribe string there should be 7 "C String-Terminators" (\0).
Table Headers

Files are sorted by their file extension into 'tables'.
This makes extracting specific file types easier since each table only contains a single file type.

Table headers are laid out like so:
Total: 12 bytes
Length 		C# Type 	Description
1 bytes 	string 		Related to file type
3 bytes 	string 		Extension (reversed)
4 bytes 	int 		Table Offset
4 bytes 	int 		File Count
Tables

At the start of each table is n groups of data related to the files in this table (where n is File Count).

File Info
Total: 12 bytes
Length 		C# Type 	Description
4 bytes 	int 		File ID
4 bytes 	int 		File Offset
4 bytes 	int 		Table Size

You can generate a psuedo-name for each file in the table you are currently iterating by doing (C#):
string.Format("{0}.{1}", FileID.ToString(), currentTable.Extension);

Remember to reverse currentTable.Extension either when parsing it or when creating the psuedo-name.
